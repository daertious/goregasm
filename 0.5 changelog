# GOREGASM — Dev Log 0.5

## Overview
Update 0.5 focuses on **foundational systems**, stability, and long-term structure.
The goal of this update is not content volume, but creating a solid base for future expansions (intimacy systems, rooms, performance, and player feedback tools).

---

## New Dimension & Room Structure

Added a **small hub dimension** leading to a central hall with **three doors**:

- Jane’s Room  
- Demon’s Room (Player Room)  
- Witch’s Room  

Each room is designed to lead to its **own separate dimension**, introducing unique mechanics and systems.

Current state:
- Jane’s Room → **first active room**
- Demon’s Room → planned, not accessible yet
- Witch’s Room → planned, not accessible yet

This structure allows modular expansion without breaking core gameplay.

## Jane Rework – Focus of Update 0.5

### Intimate / Relationship System
- Relationship progression tied to **short quests**
- Intimacy levels unlock:
  - new dialogues
  - lore fragments
  - NSFW scenes
- Dialogues evolve with progression

All of Jane’s dialogues now have **full voiceover**.

---

## JOI System (Work in Progress)

JOI system is located **inside Jane’s Room**.

Design philosophy:
- Simplified JOI compared to projects where JOI is the main gameplay
- Acts as a **supporting intimacy system**, not the core loop
- Integrated into GOREGASM’s pacing and atmosphere

Current features:
- **Beat system during Edge Phase**
- Multiple **small animation variations**
- **Text dialogue box** (commands / dialogue from Jane)
- **Basic settings**:
  - session duration
  - room for expansion later

Still in progress:
- Additional animation sets for Jane
- Timing balance between phases
- Animation pacing and transitions

Visual showcase planned once animations reach a presentable state.

## Skill Points Exchange – Rework

Previous behavior:
- Required replaying an NSFW scene every time

New behavior:
- **Instant exchange**
- No forced scene replay
- Preserves intimacy system while respecting player time

---

## Wardrobe System (Early Framework)

- Base system for future outfits
- Currently allows:
  - equipping
  - removing  
  parts of Jane’s default outfit

System is intentionally minimal for now, focused on future expandability.

---

## Graphics & Settings Improvements

### DirectX Selection
- Added **DX11 / DX12 selection**
- Game now launches in **DX11 by default**
- DX12 available manually via settings
- Visual differences noticeable in lighting and shadows
- Active DirectX version displayed on-screen (e.g. D3D11)

Reason:
- DX12-only launch caused performance and startup issues for some players

---

### Restart-Required Settings
- Some settings now require a **game restart**
- These options are clearly marked
- Warning popup appears when exiting settings if restart is needed

---

### Anti-Aliasing
- Added **DLAA**
- Requires community testing due to hardware variety
- Single-system limitation on dev side

---

## Bug Report System

Added an in-game **Bug Report tool**.

Available:
- in menu
- during gameplay
- during combat

Allows players to submit:
- bugs (critical / minor)
- technical issues
- suggestions
- general feedback

Each report includes:
- title
- report type
- description
- screenshot
- log file (if error occurred)

Reports are delivered to a **private Discord channel**, making debugging faster and more precise.

---

## Community & Infrastructure

- Discord invite system updated
- New invites embedded in:
  - websites
  - future GOREGASM versions
- Older Sacred Lust builds cannot update embedded links
- Future projects will use **online-updatable links**

---

## Development Notes

- Update 0.5 is about **systems, structure, and stability**
- Content depth will follow once systems are solid
- Heavy reliance on community testing due to hardware diversity
- Foundation laid for:
  - expanded JOI content
  - additional dimensions
  - deeper character interaction

Update 0.5 — **in active development**
